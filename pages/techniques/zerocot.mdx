# Zero-Shot CoT

One recent idea that came out more recently is the idea of [zero-shot CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) (Kojima et al. 2022) that essentially involves adding "Let's think step by step" to the original prompt. Let's try a simple problem and see how the model performs:

*Prompt:*
```
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?
```

*Output:*
```
11 apples
```

The answer is incorrect! Now Let's try with the special prompt. 

*Prompt:*
```
I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?

Let's think step by step.
```

*Output:*
```
First, you started with 10 apples.
You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left.
Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples.
Finally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.
```

It's actually impressive that this simple prompt is effective at this task. This is particularly useful where you don't have too many examples to use in the prompt.
