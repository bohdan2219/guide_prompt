# Zero-Shot Prompting
LLMs today trained on large amounts of data and tuned to follow instructions, are capable of performing tasks zero-shot. We actually tried a few zero-shot examples in the previous section. Here is one of the examples we used:

*Prompt:*
```
Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. 

Text: I think the vacation is okay.
Sentiment:
```

*Output:*
```
Neutral
```

Note that in the prompt above we didn't provide the model any examples -- that's the zero-shot capabilities at work. When zero-shot doesn't work, it's recommended to provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt. Below we discuss the approach known as few-shot prompting.
