# Introduction

Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.

This guide covers the basics of standard prompts to provide a rough idea on how to use prompts to interact and instruct large language models (LLMs). 

All examples are tested with `text-davinci-003` (using OpenAI's playground) unless otherwise specified. It uses the default configurations, e.g., `temperature=0.7` and `top-p=1`.
